# Waste-Sorting-Using-Computer-Vision-Model
Project Overview
This project leverages deep learning and computer vision techniques to classify waste into different categories using image recognition. The model is based on MobileNetV2, a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), fine-tuned for waste classification to enhance recycling and waste management efforts.

🚀 Features
* Image Preprocessing & Augmentation using TensorFlow’s ImageDataGenerator
* Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2 for efficient waste classification
* Training & Validation on a labeled waste dataset
* Evaluation Metrics including accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

🛠️ Technologies Used
* Python
* TensorFlow & Keras
* OpenCV & PIL for image processing
* Jupyter Notebook

📊 Dataset
The dataset contains images of various waste materials categorized into different types (e.g., plastic, paper, glass, metal, organic).

🔥 How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Load and preprocess the dataset
4. Train the MobileNetV2-based model
5. Test and evaluate the model with new waste images
